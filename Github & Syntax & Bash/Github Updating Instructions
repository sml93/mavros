For tracked files:
	1. Check git status
	2. git commit -a  to commit all tracked files (type commit msg and use ctrl-x to save and commit)
	3. git push -u origin (your branch) to push your commits to your branch on github eg. git push -u origin PX4-SITL
	4. Check git status one more time to see if everything has been properly UPDATED cos its updating tracked files

For untracked files such as those that you have added in:
	1. Check git status
	2. git add -i  to add all untracked aka NEW files/commits (TYPE a (for "add untracked"), then * (for "all"), then q (to quit) and you're done!)
	3. git commit -a  to commit all tracked files (type commit msg and use ctrl-x to save and commit)
	4. git push -u origin (your branch) to push your commits to your branch on github eg. git push -u origin PX4-SITL 
	5. Check git status one more time to see if everything has been properly ADDED cos its adding untracked files

ps: in the event you have an annoying file like teraranger_description, you can do git add sim/models/teraranger_description for eg.

To create a branch, push a branch and update a branch:
	1. git branch shadow_sitl
	2. git checkout shadow_sitl
	2. git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Emmanuel555/avoidance.git
	3. git push -u origin shadow_sitl (commit) branch is shadow_sitl

	   git pull origin shadow_sitl (extract from repo) branch is shadow_sitl

	4. Execute push for either tracked or untracked files (refer to the above)



when you have merge problems:

git add .
git commit
git pull origin shadow_sitl


Revert github commits:
git log
git revert the commit (the long ass number above each commit, key in the commit you wish to go back to)
git push origin shadow_sitl (dun have to git commit cos it's reverting back to a previous commit)

Drop your commits:
git stash  
git stash drop stash@{0}

cannot copy and paste files from outside into repo for github
you need to either create a new file, or copy and paste an existing file inside and modify from there.fking lame!
